    <h5>Skills and Achievements</h5>
    <ul>
    <li>
    <h6>Organization</h6>
        <p>I was able to successfully and continously meet all of the deadlines
        expected of me throughout the study for my degree, managing my time to ensure I was
        able to consistently meet deadlines for multiple different modules to a sufficent quality
        simultaiounsly. Due to relying on public transportation each day, I also learned how to 
        adequtately and sufficently manage my time in order to remain punctual and maintain a consistent
        schedule for both my taught study and my independent research.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h6>Working as part of a team</h6>
        <p>Several of the modules in both degrees required varying levels of group cooperation, 
        either as collaborative research, or as presenting a case study or argument to the wider class
        and lecturer in order to inform them on a topic. This required coordination on the divison
        of labour amongst the group and required ensuring each team member was cooperating to a shared
        final product.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h6>Independently Managed Projects</h6>
        <p>As part of my dissertations, I was required to carry out in depth research into a subject
        not previously covered by any of the taught modules in the couse, and produce a thesis to
        prevent to a supervisor. This research and subsequent essay was produced independently, and
        required me to draw from a wide-range of sources that I was able to find myself using
        the research skills I had learned throughout my study</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h6>Analtyical Thinking</h6>
        <p>As part of the assessment process, many of the degree's modules required me to produce
            a detailed analysis of a certain subject matter, and then convince either my lecturer
            or the wider class of the validity of my thesis, either through a peer-reviewed written
            essay or a presentation. As a result, I had to both analyse both the potential biases
            of the sources I was using as evidence, as well as be aware of any potential biases I had
            myself towards the topic that may otherwise affect my analysis.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h6>Information Technology</h6>
        <p>I am fully computer literate and have used Microsoft Word, Excel, and Outlook, in addition
            to Google docs extensively as part of my study. This required having my own personal files 
            were efficently sorted and organized in order to make my taken notes and own independent research
            more easily accessiable for use.
        </p>
